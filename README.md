# Case Study Assignment (Zelle) - Erik McFarlane

## Overview and Origin

The company that my case study is on is the mobile payment provider, Zelle.  Zelle itself was launched in 2017(3), however, had been operating since 2011 under the brand clearXchange until it was sold to Early Warning Services and rebranded as Zelle(1)(2)(4). 
clearXchange was developed to directly counter PayPal's electronic money transfer service. According to one of the founders of clearXchange, Mike Kennedy, "Customers want to move payments from paper to electronic methods, so if we can meet our customers' financial needs, they will be better customers with us (1)"
clearXchange (Zelle) was a private venture between several large banks (Bank of America Corp., Wells Fargo & Co. and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.(1)) and thus was not funded as a typical start-up through the various funding stages.  The Banks that developed clearXchange sold it to Early Warning Services, LLC(4) in 2016 for an undisclosed price and as a privately-held company Early Warning Services has not disclosed how much has been spent to develop clearXchange into what we know today as Zelle.

## Business Activities:

Zelle primarily started to solve the P2P (peer to peer, namely between individuals not institutions) money transfer problem.  Traditionally, individuals would have to give money by exchanging cash or writing one another a check. Other P2P payment servcies, such as ACH deposits, were slow, complex and incurred additional fees. Additionally, because
The company's primary target is individuals wishing to send and receive money from one another, however, they have also been diversifying into small business and distributions payments(6). In 2021, Intelligence Insider projects the P2P payment market to be $785 billion dollars, with projected growth to $1.2 trillion by 2024(5). 


* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
Zelle currently utilizes the RTP Network(7) which was launched by The Clearing House in November 2017 as a way to bring real-time payments to individuals(8). Modern Treasury describes RTP as a 24/7 instant "push/credit" transfer service to complete with ACH payments and Wire Transfers and offers distinct advantages, such as instant settlement time, "credit" pushes (i.e. no failures due to insufficent funds), year-round availability, and low cost-per payment(9).  RTP is a network similar to ACH or Wire transfer that financial institutions must sign-up for and pay fees on every transfer.
## Landscape:
Zelle operates within the financial payments segment of FinTech. The major trend over the past five to ten years has been mobile and wireless payments.  Zelle has been a leader in mobile P2P payments, but that is not the only area that has seen explosive innovation.  The wireless mobile payments has also seen tremendous growth by some of Zelle's competitors, which are Apple (with Apply Pay and Apple Cash) and Venmo/Paypal.  

## Results

Overall, Zelle has seen very impressive growth and acheived a very high market share.  In Q3 of 2021, Zelle processed $127 Billion on 466 million transactions(6).  In this segment of FinTech, some key metrics are:
<ul>
  <li>total number of transactions, 
  <li>average transaction amount, 
  <li>active accounts,
  <li>and market share
</ul>
* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
One of the best ways to measure success in this domain is market share. 

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?


## Recommendations

Going forward, if I were in a position to recommend product/service strategy to Zelle, I would recommend that they expand into the following areas:
<ul>
  <li>Cryptocurrency transfers and purchasing</li>
  <li>Institution expansion</li>
</ul>
I think these three recommendations represent excellent avenues to acheive revenue and market share growth.  These services are ones that Zelle's competitors offer but Zelle does not offer, has limited exposure to, or has a competative advantage. For example, Venmo/PayPal is rapidly expanding into crypto currencies, "The company is working on integrations for its crypto service, like Automated Clearing House (ACH) support to enable faster payments and the ability to make transfers to third-party wallets. These enhancements, coupled with the company’s decision to raise the weekly crypto purchase limit to $100,000(10)" Zelle has a potential advantage in the space with its owned RTP network to capture the ever-growing interest in and market for crypto currency wallets and trading. <br>
In regards to institution expansion, currently Zelle is only available in the US and for only 60% of U.S. DDAs (8), wheras Wire Transfers and ACH are universally accepted in US institutions and overseas (in the case of Wire transfers). Expanding into more institutions and attempting expansion outside the US will open Zelle to more customers and revenue. RTP operates on the global standard ISO 20022 which should help limit technical issues should they move to expand outside the United States.
