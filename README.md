# Case Study Assignment (Zelle) - Erik McFarlane

## Overview and Origin

The company that my case study is on is the mobile payment provider, Zelle.  Zelle itself was launched in 2017(3), however, had been operating since 2011 under the brand clearXchange until it was sold to Early Warning Services and rebranded as Zelle(1)(2)(4). 
clearXchange was developed to directly counter PayPal's electronic money transfer service. According to one of the founders of clearXchange, Mike Kennedy, "Customers want to move payments from paper to electronic methods, so if we can meet our customers' financial needs, they will be better customers with us (1)"
clearXchange (Zelle) was a private venture between several large banks (Bank of America Corp., Wells Fargo & Co. and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.(1)) and thus was not funded as a typical start-up through the various funding stages.  The Banks that developed clearXchange sold it to Early Warning Services, LLC(4) in 2016 for an undisclosed price and as a privately-held company Early Warning Services has not disclosed how much has been spent to develop clearXchange into what we know today as Zelle.

## Business Activities:

Zelle primarily started to solve the P2P (peer to peer, namely between individuals not institutions) money transfer problem.  Traditionally, individuals would have to give money by exchanging cash or writing one another a check. Other P2P payment servcies, such as ACH deposits, were slow, complex and incurred additional fees. Additionally, because
The company's primary target is individuals wishing to send and receive money from one another, however, they have also been diversifying into small business and distributions payments(6). In 2021, Intelligence Insider projects the P2P payment market to be $785 billion dollars, with projected growth to $1.2 trillion by 2024(5). 


* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
Zelle currently utilizes the RTP Network(7) which was launched by The Clearing House in November 2017 as a way to bring real-time payments to individuals(8). Little is known about the exact implementation, however, Modern Treasury describes RTP as (9) a 24/7 instant "push/credit" transfer service to complete with ACH payments and Wire Transfers and offers distinct advantages, such as instant settlement time, "credit" pushes (i.e. no failures due to insufficent funds), and low cost-per payment.

## Recommendations

Going forward, if I were in a position to recommend product/service strategy to Zelle, I would recommend that they expand into the following areas:
<ul>
  <li>Cryptocurrency transfers and purchasing</li>
  <li>ACH support</li>
  <li>In-store payments</li>
  <li>Universal bank acceptance</li>
</ul>
All of three of these services are offerings that Zelle's competitors offer but Zelle does not or has limited exposure to. 
* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
